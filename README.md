Library Store Application

This project was created to develop my skills in the following areas:

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, NextJS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB, Mongoose

Itâ€™s a simple application that simulates a library store and persists information about books and users. Feel free to navigate in our website!
